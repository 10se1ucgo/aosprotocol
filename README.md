# aosprotocol
Documentation and development of the protocol used by AoS 0.x, OpenSpades, pyspades and piqueserver

Browse the documentation at https://piqueserver.github.io/aosprotocol.

## Workflow
You want to add a packet to AoS? Great!

### Packet Proposal
File an issue and name it `PP: PacketName`. Describe what packet you wish to add,
and how it would improve the game.

### Packet Add Request
If your packet has recieved positively it is time to write it up. 
Describe the packet in the style of the other packets and file a Pull Request snd name it `PAR: PacketName`

This started out as a dump of the aoswiki.rakiru.com Protocol page, but is meant to be the hub for
developing the AoS protocol in the future
